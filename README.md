## NFL Database Web Application
NFL Database is a web application that was created as a school project to implement a database utilizing CREATE, DELETE, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and SELECT queries. Then we created a web interface that allows the user to view all tables in the database and to edit them. You can add players, teams, divisions, team stats, etc. You can also delete players from the database.
